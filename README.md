# File Sorter

## About
This app takes in a specified directory, displays files based on extention type, and gives you options to turn what's a typically lengthy task into a quick and efficient process.

- This project uses the Qt Creator library for the UI and code in C++

## Known Bugs
- The app is currently in a very barebones state, so there are a few critical bugs that and features that need to be polished:
  - the select button functionality hasn't been implemented yet
  - critical glitch: if you change the extension then hit save, all of the files' extension in the current directory get converted into type specified in the app (please only use on "experimental" files)
  - suffix is stil a work in progress
  - the ui animations aren't complete yet

## Systems
- At the moment there is only a Windows version. I may be able to compile a Mac version in the future.
