# File Sorter

## About
This app takes in a specified directory, displays files based on extention type, and gives you options to turn what's a typically lengthy task into a quick and efficient process.

- This project uses the Qt Creator library for the UI and code in C++

## Known Bugs
- The app is complete, but it still has a few glitches here and there. I recommend only using it with test files for now.

## Systems
- At the moment there is only a Windows version. I may be able to compile a Mac version in the future.
